## HPoS Consensus

=> This is a hybrid of PoA, PoS and DPoS

=> There will be voting to onboard a new validator. If a new validator gets more than 50% of voiting from other active validators, then only he can become a validator.

=> 21 active validators will be selected for reward based on staking volume.

=> There will be delegators who can stake to any validator to earn staking reward
